# Landscaper

## You are starting a landscaping business, but all you have are your teeth.
## Using just your teeth, you can spend the day cutting lawns and make $1. You can do this as much as you want.
## As you cut grass, and accumulate money... You may chose to purchase new lawncutting tools! These tools will increase your income per lawn!

# I'll be using tupples to store values for the tools available and tool price as those will remain fixed values
toolsAvailable = ("teeth", "rusty scissors", "push lawnmower", "battery-powered lawnmower", "students")
toolPrice = (0, 25, 50, 250, 500)
# Tools owned, however, will be set as a list since there can be many of each kind owned.
toolsOwned = [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]
